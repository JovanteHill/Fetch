First I would like to say I have really enjoyed completing both the Hhbuilder and Fetch code challenges. They have allowed me to learn different ways to structure my code and find more effective ways to run it. 

With that being said I hope that I have made a good impression and have demonstrated my abilites, so that thwy either meet your standards or show promise for improvement. I have done my research into your company and I am completely onboard with what you guys are trying to do (with specific interest in thelping the veterans, as a lot of members in my family are veterans). I've read a lot of your blog post (favorite one being what it takes to be a remote employee (since I've been working remote for 2 years now)), and think that you all are a bunch of great people. I hope that alone with my code that you will remember why you are interested in me and focus on the positives and think of any negatives as an investment to further develop. 

Again I have enjoyed the challenges and appreciate the opprotunity to complete them. Hope to hear from you soon.
